              and conditions, together with any documents they expressly
              incorporate by reference (collectively, "Terms of Use"), govern
              your access to and use of https://cosmic-labs.io/ and the Cosmic
              Labs Discord server (https://discord.gg/cosmiclabsnft), including

              https://discord.gg/cosmiclabsnft (“Discord”), jointly referred to
              as “Activities”, whether as a guest or a registered user. <br />
              <br />
              Please read the Terms of Use carefully before you start to use the
              Website and/or Discord. By using the Website and/or Discord or by
              clicking to accept or agree to the Terms of Use when this option
              is made available to you, you accept and agree to be bound and
              abide by these Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy, incorporated
              herein by reference and/or directly. If you do not want to agree
              to these Terms of Use or the Privacy Policy, do not access or use
              the Website and/or Discord. <br />
              <br />
              These Activities are offered and available to users who are 18
              years of age or older and have legal contractual capacity. By
              using these Activities, you represent and warrant that you are of
              legal age to form a binding contract with the Company and meet all
              of the foregoing eligibility requirements. If you do not meet all
              of these requirements, do not access or use the Website. <br />
              <br />
              Changes to the Terms of Use <br />
              <br />
              We may revise and update these Terms of Use from time to time in
              our sole discretion. All changes are effective immediately when we
              post them, and apply to all access to and use of the Website or
              Discord thereafter. <br />
              <br />
              Your continued use of the Activities following the posting of
              revised Terms of Use means that you accept and agree to the
              changes. You have a duty to check this so you are aware of any
              changes, as they are binding on you. <br />
              <br />
              Accessing the Website and Account Security <br />
              <br />
              We reserve the right to withdraw or amend this Website and
              Discord, and any service or material we provide on the Website or
              Discord, in our sole discretion without notice. We will not be
              liable if for any reason all or any part of the Website or Discord
              is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to time,
              we may restrict access to some parts of the Website or Discord, or
              the entire Website or Discord, to users, including registered
              users. <br />
              <br />
              You are responsible for both: <br />
              <br />
              Making all arrangements necessary for you to have access.

              with them. <br />
              <br />
              Ensuring that you conduct independent research and verification
              before clicking on links, agreeing to any terms with third
              parties, joining other Discord communities, or doing anything else
              that may consummate a transaction. <br />
              <br />
              To access the Activities or some of the resources offered, you may
              be asked to provide certain registration details or other

              all the information you provide is correct, current, and complete.
              You agree that all information you provided to register,

              you consent to all actions we take with respect to your

              it to any other person or entity. You also acknowledge that your
              account is personal to you and agree not to provide any other
              person with your user name, password, or other security
              information. You agree to notify us immediately of any
              unauthorized access to or use of your user name or password or any
              other breach of security. You also agree to ensure that you exit
              from your account at the end of each session. You should use
              particular caution when accessing your account from a public or
              shared computer so that others are not able to view or record your
              password or other personal information. <br />
              <br />
              We have the right to disable any user name, password, or other
              identifier, whether chosen by you or provided by us, at any time
              in our sole discretion for any or no reason, including if, in our
              opinion, you have violated any provision of these Terms of Use.{" "}

              Non-fungible Token (NFT) Intellectual Property <br />
              <br />
              i. The Company produces and distributes multiple NFTs described as
              Cosmic and or Genesis Ducks. The term “NFT” refers only to the
              digital art associated with the cryptographically verified and
              encoded NFT, and NOT to any other proprietary materials owned by
              the company. <br />
              <br />
              ii. The wallet and/or digital storage mechanism which holds the
              NFT is entitled to full rights of ownership, whether personal,
              commercial, or otherwise. The Company’s NFTs reside on the
              Ethereum blockchain. The Company will not intervene and is not
              responsible for joint ownership. When you purchase an NFT, you own
              the underlying art completely. Ownership of the NFT is mediated
              entirely by the Smart Contract and the Ethereum Network. At no
              point may we seize, freeze, transfer, revert, or otherwise modify
              the ownership of any NFT. <br />
              <br />
              iii. Retention of Limited Commercial License. The Company retains
              a limited commercial use license in each NFT in perpetuity which
              gives permission to use all NFT art for marketing and promotional
              materials, to include the sale of merchandise or products without
              the need for prior consent from the holder insomuch as this does
              not infringe on the owner’s individual commercial production
              rights. <br />
              <br />
              iv. Personal Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these
              Terms, the Company grants you an international, royalty-free
              license to use, copy, and display the purchased NFT, along with
              any extensions that you choose to create or use, solely for the
              following purposes: (i) for your own personal, non-commercial use;
              (ii) as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale
              of your NFT, provided that the marketplace cryptographically
              verifies each NFT owner’s rights to display the Art for their NFT
              to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; or (iii)
              as part of a third party website or application that permits the
              inclusion, involvement, or participation of your NFT, provided
              that the website/application cryptographically verifies each NFT
              owner’s rights to display the Art for their NFT to ensure that
              only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the
              Art is no longer visible once the owner of the NFT leaves the
              website/application. <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              v. Commercial Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these
              Terms, the Company grants you an unlimited, international license
              to use, copy, and display the purchased Art for the purpose of
              creating derivative works based upon the Art (“Commercial Use”).
              Examples of such Commercial Use would e.g. be the use of the Art
              to produce and sell merchandise products (T-Shirts etc.)
              displaying copies of the Art. For the sake of clarity, nothing in
              this Section will be deemed to restrict you from (i) owning or
              operating a marketplace that permits the use and sale of NFTs
              generally, provided that the marketplace cryptographically
              verifies each NFT owner’s rights to display the Art for their NFT
              to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; (ii)
              owning or operating a third party website or application that
              permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of NFTs
              generally, provided that the third party website or application
              cryptographically verifies each NFT owner’s rights to display the
              Art for their NFT to ensure that only the actual owner can display
              the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the
              owner of the Purchased NFT leaves the website/application; or
              (iii) earning revenue from any of the foregoing. <br />
